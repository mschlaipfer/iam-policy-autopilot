//! [`match_waiters`] — maps [`Waiter`]s to [`SdkMethodCall`]s via
//! [`ServiceModelIndex::waiter_lookup`] and import-based filtering.
//!
//! Import filtering uses only the imports from the same source file as each waiter call.
//! See [`service_call`] module documentation for the rationale.
//!
//! When the extractor has resolved the receiver variable's declared type via
//! [`Waiter::receiver_declaration`] (e.g. `"S3Waiter"` or the fully-qualified
//! `"software.amazon.awssdk.services.s3.waiters.S3Waiter"`), the matcher performs
//! a targeted lookup to pin the call to exactly one service, rather than relying on
//! the coarser file-level import filter.
//!
//! Resolution order for Tier 1 (type name known):
//! 1. **FQN fast path**: if `type_name` starts with `software.amazon.awssdk.services.`,
//!    extract the service name directly from the prefix.
//! 2. **Import lookup**: match `type_name` against the last segment of each specific import
//!    in the file (handles the common `import ...S3Waiter;` case).
//! 3. **Service-id matching**: if no specific import matches (e.g. the file uses a `.*`
//!    wildcard import), derive the expected waiter interface name from each candidate
//!    service's `serviceId` metadata (`<ServiceId>Waiter`, spaces stripped) and match
//!    against `type_name`.  This handles `import software.amazon.awssdk.services.s3.*;`
//!    with `S3Waiter waiter = ...`.
//!
//! # Why `SdkMethodCall.name` uses the underlying operation, not the waiter name
//!
//! A Java waiter call like `waiter.waitUntilTableExists(req)` internally polls
//! `DynamoDB::DescribeTable`.  The enrichment layer converts `SdkMethodCall.name`
//! from camelCase to PascalCase and looks it up in the service reference to find the
//! required IAM actions.  If we stored the waiter name (`"tableExists"`) the enrichment
//! would look for a `"TableExists"` operation — which does not exist in the service
//! reference — and produce an empty policy.  Instead we store the **underlying operation
//! name** in camelCase (e.g. `"describeTable"`), so enrichment correctly resolves it to
//! `"DescribeTable"` → `dynamodb:DescribeTable`.
//!
//! When a waiter maps to the same underlying operation across multiple services (e.g.
//! two fictional services both poll `DescribeResource`), all refs share the same
//! `operation_name`, so the single camelCase name is unambiguous.
//!
//! [`service_call`]: super::service_call
